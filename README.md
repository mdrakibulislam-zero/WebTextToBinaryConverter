## What Have I Done:
I've made this text to binary converter using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used normalize-5.0.0.css for getting better cross-browser consistency. I've also used prefixfree-1.0.7.js for use only unprefixed CSS properties everywhere.

Normalize. css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It's a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.

Prefixfree is a script that lets you use only unprefixed CSS properties everywhere. It works behind the scenes, adding the current browser's prefix to any CSS code, only when it's needed.
